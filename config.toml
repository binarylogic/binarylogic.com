About = """
I'm an engineer and founder living in New York City. I'm currently cooking up something new. If you're an ambitious builder looking for something new, reach out!

In 2016, I co-founded [Timber](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/timber), a logging SaaS, where we developed [Vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector), a popular open-source project that is widely used by engineering teams at organizations like Apple, NASA, and Hashicorp. Vector was acquired by Datadog in 2020, where it's the backbone of Datadogâ€™s Observability Pipelines product. Earlier, in 2007, I co-founded [Concierge Live](http://conciergelive.com), an enterprise SaaS that tracked the usage of corporate event tickets. While working on Concierge Live I created [Authlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) and [Searchlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic), which some may recall from the early days of Ruby.

Along with [Zach Sherman](https://zach.sh), my co-founder at Timber, I invest through [Whoa.vc](https://whoa.vc).

Outside of work, I enjoy biking, running, swimming, and anything outdoors. Participating in triathlons is a hobby of mine.
